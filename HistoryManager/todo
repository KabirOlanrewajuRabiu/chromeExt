// Periodically scan the history? Every hour maybe or every day?
// Process into sources and destinations
// Process time spent on each
// figure out how to show a page with details and settings
// how do extensions get a settings page
// extract out the time ranges for each

// CONTINUE
// Add configurable timelines: day, hour, month, year?
// Use $$ selector with id and data fields to get values; pass to history function and reset table
// Allow drill
// Allow categories
// figure out a way to structure the folders and files better
// Allow diving into one header to dive into analysis of that hostname
// figure out how to extract time spent on each visit to a page
// Coalesce into a daily view for top pages?
// style the table page
// consider creating a one-hit wonder category to highlight mindless scrolling and time sinks on the internet

// Periodically scan the history? Every hour maybe or every day?
// Process into sources and destinations
// Process time spent on each
// figure out how to show a page with details and settings
// how do extensions get a settings page
// extract out the time ranges for each

// CONTINUE
// Build a table showing each top site and a count - DOM manipulator
// Extract each page domain
// Coalesce into a daily view for top pages?
// Brute force first - just calculate everything in one go - on demand; then optimize afterwards
